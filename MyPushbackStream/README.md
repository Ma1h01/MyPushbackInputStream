    This is a program that mimics the functionality of Java's "PushbackInputStream."
    Unlike the regular "PushbackInputStream," my program first creates a "MyStack" class(a stack data structure that only takes in "byte" type datas), then it replaces the regular array(used in regular "PushbackInputStream") with "MyStack" in "MyPushbackInputSream" class which extends "FilterInputStream".
